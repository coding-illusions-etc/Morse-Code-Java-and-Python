# Morse-Code-Java-and-Python
Contains programs of decryption and encryption of morse code written in python and java.

The python program works fine with the regular python idle (install python from this link https://www.python.org/downloads/)

The java code works best on BlueJ and is divided into 2 parts : a package for easy future use and and the main body to call the packages and enter input.
